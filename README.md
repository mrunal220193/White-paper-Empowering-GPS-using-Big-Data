## abstract
        Location is an important metric when it comes to data. Be it
        the data of a Retailer which wants to analyze the customer
        behaviour in a given demography, or the Policemen who want to
        look into a particular crime committed in a given region, or
        tracking down a criminal's hideout, or a commercial giant
        wanting to figure out the ideal location for setting up a new
        plant to maximize their profits, location and geography play
        an important role. Knowing the geography can help immensely in
        generating more value in analysis, and in some extreme cases,
        like that of the census data of a country without the
        geography, the other data may prove to be meaningless. Since
        magnanimous amounts of data is getting generated every single
        second, at a break-neck speed, companies from across different
        domains, be it Insurance, Retail, Banking, Finance, Health
        care, Telecommunications, etc are quickly shifting to Big Data
        technologies from their traditional approaches. Thus it is an
        essential task to develop systems which empower the
        traditional Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with the Big
        data technologies to enhance the analysis and generation of
        insights.
